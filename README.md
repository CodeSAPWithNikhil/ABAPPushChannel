**ABAP Push Channels for Real-Time UI5 Updates**  

ABAP Push Channels (APC) provide WebSocket-based communication in SAPâ€™s ABAP environment. They enable real-time message push from the backend to SAPUI5 apps without polling.  

When a business event occurs, the backend sends a message via APC, and the UI5 app receives it instantly using WebSocket APIs like `sap.ui.core.ws.WebSocket`. This improves performance and user experience.  

APC is often used in combination with ABAP Messaging Channels (AMC), which support a publish/subscribe model for inter-session communication. By binding an AMC channel to a WebSocket connection, developers can implement collaboration scenarios where messages are filtered per user or session, ensuring that each UI5 client receives only its relevant notifications.
